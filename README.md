# Low-Power-optimization-using-fir-filter-in-VLSI-design
This project focuses on designing a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter optimized for low power consumption in VLSI systems. Techniques such as coefficient symmetry, multiplierless design, and clock gating are used to minimize switching activity and reduce power.
